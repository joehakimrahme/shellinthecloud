If you're using a Unix box, your system comes with a built in dictionary. I use this file to come up with random names.

It picks a random word and removes a random vowel from it.
    

    import random
    
    
    dictionary = "/usr/share/dict/words"
    VOWELS = "aeiouy"
    
    with open(dictionary) as d:
        words = d.readlines()
        title = random.choice(words)
        print title.replace(random.choice([v for v in VOWELS if v in title]), "")


Here are some results I got from it:

    >>> zeugldntid
    >>> sptmfid
    >>> pleurodyna
    >>> bratticr
    >>> vigilant
    >>> ntamable

Have fun.
