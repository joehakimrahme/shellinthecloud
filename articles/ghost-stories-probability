Ghost Stories Probabilities
===========================

This problem is an exercise in probability inspired by an amazing board game
called [Ghost Stories]. In this game, we play Taoist monks fending off ghost
invasions to protect the villagers from Wu-Feng, the Lord of Hell, and his army.

A core mechanic of the game is to exorcise ghosts. Here's how the game works:

+ A ghost has a power and a color. For instance 'red2' has power=2 and
  color='red'
+ There are 6 colors in the game:
  ('black', 'white', 'red', 'yellow', 'green', 'blue')
+ Players have dice with each of the 6 color on their sides. The dice are
  perfectly balanced.
+ In order to successfuly exorcise, the players roll 3 dice and need to match
  the power of the monster. For instance if I try to exorcise a 'red2' ghost, I
  need to roll at least 2 reds out of the 3 I throw.
+ White is always a wild card. No matter the color of the ghost, a white roll is
  always a hit.
+ There are no white ghosts.

**Level 1**: Give the probability of exorcising a ghostX for
    X=1, X=2, X=3

The Taoist monks we play have some special abilities to improve their odds a
bit. For instance the green Taoist has a fourth die only he can use during
exorcisms.

**Level 2**: Give the probability of green Taoist exorcising a ghostX for
    X=1, X=2, X=3 and X=4

The blue Taoist has the ability to fight twice. If his first exorcism fails, he
immediately re-rolls 3 dice.

**Level 3**: Give the probability of blue Taoist exorcising a ghostX for
    X=1, X=2, X=3

One of the incarnations of Wu-Feng, Nameless, has the very evil power of
nullifying the power of white rolls. As long as it is on the board, every white
roll counts for a miss.

**Final boss**: Go through level 1, 2 and 3 with Nameless on the board.
