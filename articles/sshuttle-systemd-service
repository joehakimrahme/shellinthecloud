Running sshuttle as a systemd service
=====================================

Here's the service unit file I wrote to launch sshuttle as a systemd
service.

    [Unit]
    Description=sshuttle service a permanent tunnel
    After=network.target

    [Service]
    ExecStart=/usr/bin/sshuttle -r user@host 0.0.0.0/0 --dns -D --pidfile=/var/run/sshuttle.pid
    Restart=no
    Type=forking
    PIDFile=/var/run/sshuttle.pid
    User=root

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target

A couple of specifications:

* I had to define the `User` to be root explicitely as to avoid
  entering the sudoer password explicitly.

* make sure to launch sshuttle with `-D` so that it behaves like a
  proper daemon.

More info about sshuttle can be
found [on their website](http://sshuttle.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
