How do you share large files?
=============================

There are 3 ways I can think of to share files like pictures and videos with my
friends:

* Email
* 3rd party services (like [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com), or
  [Wetransfer](https://www.wetransfer.com))
* Upload the file to a server yourself and provide your friend with a
  downloadable URL.
  
While email is great for sharing small files quickly, it falls short when
sharing a lot of files, or worse, a single large file (> 20 MB or so). Here's
what
[Wikipedia has to say about it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_attachment):

> when Google's gmail service increased its arbitrary limit to 25MB it warned
> that: "you may not be able to send larger attachments to contacts who use
> other email services with smaller attachment limits". In general, 10MB is
> considered safe for the maximum size of an email.

3rd party services usually work very well but they come at the cost of privacy,
control and flexibility. It's possible to mitigate the privacy cost by using
cryptography, but this method will always be limited by the fact that you're
handing someone else your data and asking them to transfer it to your friend.

The final option, the DIY one, may seem like a major overhead: Creating an
online server to hold the file and configuring some daemon to serve it could
take a lot of time and money. After all, you just want to send a single file to
your friend, it shouldn't take this much effort.

Quickshare-playbook
-------------------

With Ansible (and an account at a solid cloud provider), I've figured out how to
automate the deployment of the DIY option. I wrote a playbook and published it
here: https://github.com/joehakimrahme/quickshare-playbook
    

The playbook comes with a quickstart guide in its README file detailing usage
instructions. You will need to have a CentOS machine running somewhere. Cloud
providers are perfect for this because you can spawn a machine quickly without
downloading any ISO or using any of your local hardware performance. Also, they
only bill you by the hour, meaning you can conveniently dispose of the VM as
soon as the transfer is done and only be billed for the period of time it was
up.

For now the playbook is pretty rudimentary:

* set up [vsftpd](https://security.appspot.com/vsftpd.html) and configure it to
  allow anonymous downloads
* upload the file to the FTP server.


That's about it. In future releases I want to add more features like HTTP
download, authentication, and multi-file support. In the meantime, I'm
publishing this with the hope of getting early feedback to see what people think
of this approach.
