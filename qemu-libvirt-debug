Purpose: The below can be useful in any scenario where you'd like to
know the interactions between libvirt and QEMU. But the below talks
in the context of a live migration bug.

If possible to perform the live migration test again, some log files
that can be useful:

  * Sanitized Nova debug logs (preferably contextual on the source and
    destination hosts): compute.log, conductor.log, scheduler.log

    To enable Nova debug logs, add these config attributes:
        . . .
        verbose = True
        debug = True
        . . .

    Restart Nova services:

        $ openstack-service restart nova

  * /var/log/libvirt/qemu/instance.log -- For both compute nodes involved.
    This will give us the QEMU CLI that's being used by libvirt

    If the test can be repeated, it'll be useful to enable debug logging
    for libvirt on the Compute nodes involved. As libvirt is the
    component that's doing the heavy lifting under the hood. These
    logs gives us detailed interactions between libvirt and QEMU on
    source and destination Compute nodes. To enable:

     1. In /etc/libvirt/libvirtd.conf, have these two config attributes:

        . . .
        log_filters="1:libvirt 1:qemu 1:conf 1:security 3:event 3:json 3:file 3:object 1:util"
        log_outputs="1:file:/var/log/libvirt/libvirtd.log"
        . . .

     2. Restart libvirtd:

        $ systemctl restart libvirtd

     3. Repeat the test.

     4. Capture the libvirt logs and attach them as plain text to the
        bug.


NOTE: Do *not* forget to turn off both the Nova and libvirt debugging
controls once the test is finished -- otherwise, it continues to log
heavily and can fill up the disk space quickly.
